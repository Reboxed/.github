> 🗣️ I don't want this to be a “yet-another-aws-wrapper” project like Netlify or Vercel (which it isn't, I ain't just using AWS lambdas), this is just a project of my own and treated as such and even if it doesn't go big, it still will always be a love project of mine for whom me and my friends are the target audience — this wasn't founded for others, but mostly for myself, and I am just turning it into a product as I've seen many others also look for similar integrated products.<br>

There was a quirky paragraph here before that I deemed to no longer fit, but without much yap — I am really passionate for Rebxd and it's a project I would like to use for myself for the most part and if y'all like it then that's good, if not, that's fine too :).
