### Why Rebxd?

**Unified**  
All essential backend and deployment services in one place: (globally distributed) compute, authentication, storage buckets, databases, and secure frontend-friendly policies.

**Infrastructure as TypeScript**  
Define your architecture inside your repo with full typing, autocomplete, validation, and consistent service-to-service connections.

**Automatic deployments**  
Rebxd handles build, linking, and deployment in one step. Push, run `rxd deploy`, and your entire stack updates.

**Commit your deployment stack**  
Commit your `.rebxd/` directory and anyone can bootstrap and deploy your full setup themselves.

**Language-agnostic**  
TypeScript gets first-class inference and tooling; other languages work via generated clients, with expanded support planned.
