> üó£Ô∏è I don't want this to be a ‚Äúyet-another-aws-wrapper‚Äù project like Netlify or Vercel (which it isn't, I ain't just using AWS lambdas), this is just a project of my own and treated as such and even if it doesn't go big, it still will always be a love project of mine for whom me and my friends are the target audience ‚Äî this wasn't founded for others, but mostly for myself, and I am just turning it into a product as I've seen many others also look for similar integrated products.<br>

Every single host out there that isn't the big three (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure) are all the same. They have the same features, overall similar look and annoying use of several different panels for multiple resons, no innovations, nothing new ‚Äî we'd like to change that.

With our fully custom panel and website we power features no one could even do before such as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTEED] (don't worry little sneaker, you will find out soon enough) and bring a whole new experience to the table.

Additionally, we want to offer high-quality hosting with top-tier support and high availability at a reasonable prize as well.
