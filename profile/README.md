> üó£Ô∏è I don't want this to be a ‚Äúyet-another-aws-wrapper‚Äù project like Netlify or Vercel (which it isn't, I ain't just using AWS lambdas), this is just a project of my own and treated as such and even if it doesn't go big, it still will always be a love project of mine for whom me and my friends are the target audience ‚Äî this wasn't founded for others, but mostly for myself, and I am just turning it into a product as I've seen many others also look for similar integrated products.<br>
> \- Me, ig

Every single cloud out there that isn't the big three (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure) are all the same and have only a single product so you need to subscribe to 6 different services for your app, we call that "serverless hell". No proper seamless integrations. No cool features. No will to move further. We would like to change this.

With our near fully custom systems we power features no one could even do before such as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTEED] (don't worry little sneaker, you will find out soon enough) and bring a whole new experience to the table.
