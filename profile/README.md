**The way to deploy and host redefined ‚Äî with massive innovations and integrations provided by the Rebxd Cloud.**

> üó£Ô∏è I don't want this to be a ‚Äúyet-another-aws-wrapper‚Äù project like Netlify or Vercel (which it isn't, I ain't just using AWS lambdas), this is just a project of my own and treated as such and even if it doesn't go big, it still will always be a love project of mine for whom me and my friends are the target audience ‚Äî this wasn't founded for others, but mostly for myself, and I am just turning it into a product as I've seen many others also look for similar integrated products.<br>
> \- Me, ig

There was a quirky paragraph here before that I deemed to no longer fit, but without much yap ‚Äî I am really passionate for Rebxd and it's a project I would like to use for myself for the most part and if y'all like it then that's good, if not, that's fine too :).

### But if you do, it's time to go [Reboxed](https://rebxd.com).

### Why Rebxd?

Rebxd is a fully integrated ecosystem for deployment, developing your side-projects, applications and projects simply while keeping it all in one place ‚Äî A completely hassle-free experience with everything you need in one unified place that we provide and grow for and with you.

<details>
  <summary><strong>üîó Integrated</strong></summary>
  
  We provide many services for you like Authentication, Serverless (soon Edge deployments too!), Storage Buckets and Reactive Realtime Databases while being tightly integrated with each other and even allowing third-party integrations and connections with ease to not miss out on anything.
  </details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>‚ú® Artificial Intelligence ‚ú®</strong></summary>
  
  No good tech product exists in 2025 without mentioning AI, we're sorry...  
  Blitz Agent, our own vibe code builder, makes use of our tools to ensure a true no-effort project creation that starts from 0 to hero in no time! We're working on even training our own AI model at the time called Blitz-One, let's see how that goes ü§û.  
  (Coming soon ‚Äî WIP)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>üì¢ We push your products</strong></summary>
  
  On our homepage we will show off what people make on Rebxd if you wish and support you in hopefully going somewhere as well by creating a whole hub for indie or exciting new products that were created with our help.
